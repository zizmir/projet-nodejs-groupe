Back to me
Before starting the project you NEED to create a team of 2/3 students and nominate a project manager who will be responsible for:
Sending the team members
Sending the team name
Sending your work

You MUST send to majdi.toumi+cdiwm+node+mini@gmail.com your homework with the link or your github repository.

E-mail subject has to be: project :: node :: mini :: {TEAM_NAME}

!! Focus 0x1 â†’ replace {TEAM_NAME} by yours 
!! Focus 0x2 â†’ a late release is 0
!! Focus 0x3 â†’ everything has to be in englishâ€¦ even e-mails :)
